# NSS Capstone Presentation Instructions

Each presentation should take approximately **5 minutes** and cover the following material:

1. Project Goals (30 seconds)
    * Pull these from your capstone proposal, Trello board, GitProject and/or README. Goals should be measurable.
2. Demo (2 minutes)
    * You don't have to demonstrate all of the functionality, just the high points.
    * Demonstrating the ability to sign-in/sign-up is a poor use of time unless there is something special about your sign-in/up process. So, have a logged-in user and be ready to go when you present.
3. Lessons Learned (1 minute)
    * This can be cathartic!
4. Question and Answer time
    * There will be questions, I promise.  Ask for questions and then pause while people gather their thoughts.


## Important points to remember:

* Use a tool to assist preparing your presentation  (Google Docs has slides). This should take you no more than 10 minutes to complete.
* Speak loudly and clearly, and face your audience.
* Be positive and use positive words. **DO NOT** emphasize broken parts of the program.  If you notice a bug while you're presenting, just gloss past it. This is an important skill to learn for giving product demos.
* **DO NOT** insult your own work.  People tend to take a person's self-evaluation at face value and you'll simply be setting people up to think your work is sub-par.
* Avoid referencing other student's presentations in a "well, they covered everything I had to say on my lessons learned".  Your presentation should stand alone.
* Your presentation and application should be complete the evening before presentations. You are expected to have your laptop closed and your attention on the presenter during the presentations.

## Presentation order 
We will demo in groups of 6 or 7 with ten minute breaks between. The goal is to be done by about 1:30 pm. The order will be given to you the day before. If you have a preference for going in the first or last group, let your instructor team know by Monday morning the day before your presentation.
